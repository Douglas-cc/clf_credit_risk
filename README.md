# Automatic Credit Risk Classification System

## ‚≠ê  Quick Start  ‚≠ê

</div>


## üéØ Objectives

The system aims to classify the risk of granting bank credit to a customer. Essentially, the user provides input data, and the system returns whether there is a risk or not in granting bank credit to that customer. Additionally, the API has endpoints where we can save the results in a SQL database, list all classifications, and search for classifications already performed by name.

## üìù Description of Input Variables

- name: customer's name
- loan: income commitment
- income: income
- age: age
- date: date and time of classification

## üìà Machine Learning Model Techniques Used

Our REST API was created in FastAPI to consume trained machine learning models that were saved in serialized .pkl files. However, it is worth noting that our data is sparse in information, and in real life, we would have many other features to explore and train, which gives the model the power to generalize. We could also apply feature engineering techniques. However, this project aimed to explore the end-to-end design process as much as possible. In essence, we counted on an MVP. Below are some models explored, as you can see in our notebook:

- Gradient Boost Models
- LOGISTIC REGRESSION
- KNN
- RANDOM FOREST
- SVM
- NAIVE BAYES

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Docker
- FastAPI
- Alembic
- Scikit-learn 
- XGBOOST
- LIGHTGBM
- CATBOOST

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
pip install virtualenv; python3.11 -m virtualenv .venv --python=python3.11; source .venv/bin/activate
```
Or with docker-compose: 

```bash
docker compose up 
```

### Run Frontend and API Locally
Inside the app directory, execute the command to start the API:

```bash
uvicorn server:app --reload
```
Inside the frontend directory, execute the command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
OUTPUT: 
  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
  Network URL: http://192.168.1.103:8501


Inside the src directory, execute the command:

```bash
uvicorn server:app --reload
```

### API Documentation and Endpoints
And then test the endpoints to generate classification, search for classifications by name, and list all classifications already performed.
